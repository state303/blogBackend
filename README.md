I tried to sort class and interface however, it's not easy to sort these out correctly. 
Furthermore, due to lack of background knowledge on fundamentals, I couldn't even code properly. 
Basically, I feel like I cannot see the whole tree that I cannot interconnect the concepts, ideas, and knowledge that I've studied for.
